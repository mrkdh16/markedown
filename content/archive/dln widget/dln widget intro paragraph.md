The learning dynamics of deep neural networks are, at first glance, quite puzzling. Watch what happens when you train a depth-3 ReLU network: the loss _plateaus_ for long stretches, then *rapidly* drops. Look at the network's current input-output map—the matrix that best summarizes what the network has learned so far—and decompose it into its principal components via the SVD. Each singular value measures how strongly the network has learned one independent mode of the input-output relationship. You'll see that they aren't learned all at once. Instead, they're learned _sequentially_: one singular value 'grows' from near-zero to its final magnitude while the others wait their turn. And there's an order to it: the largest singular values, corresponding to the most important modes of the data, are learned first. 

These are fascinating dynamics, and you might assume they emerge from the complexity of nonlinear activations. But here's the surprising part: switch to the left-hand panel and select a deep _linear_ network. You'll see the same stepwise loss (clearest in depth-3), the same sequential learning of singular values, the same largest-first ordering. A depth-1 linear network shows none of this—just smooth exponential decay—so these phenomena are a signature of _depth_, not nonlinearity. 

This is what makes deep linear networks so valuable: they're **simple enough to analyze mathematically, yet they reproduce the key learning dynamics of their nonlinear counterparts**. In the section below, we solve exactly for the learning dynamics of a depth-2 linear network.
